Part 2
My data is a representation over time of how different companies contribute with code to the development of a mobile application.
The sequences are representing the intensity of how they upload such data

There is a multichannel sequence per case
The nature of the sequences s chronological. Event Sequences by definition

The alphabet is just the type of company and 0 for no activity, 1 for activity

Size of the alphabet, the same will take only the case with activity

Sequences 15
My interesnce is to find the sequencing (how frequently the companies contirbute), when they contribute (timing), no duration or quantum
